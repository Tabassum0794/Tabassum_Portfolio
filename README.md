## [Project 1: Categorizing Unlabeled Data](https://github.com/Tabassum0794/Machine-Learning/tree/main/CategorizingData)
  1. Machine learning Algorithm: Agglomerative clustering, K-means, k-nearest neighbors(KNN)
  2. Unsupervised machine learning algorithm is used to label and classify the unlabeled data into classes
  3. Using the supervised machine learning algorithm further increased the accuracy rate of the model
     
## [Project 2: Diabetes prediction](https://github.com/Tabassum0794/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction)
  1. Three models are trained using supervised machine learning algorithms
  2. K-nearest neighbors(KNN algorithm), Support vector machine (SVM), ensemble learning algorithm
  3. Evaluation is performed based on time complexity and accuracy rate
  4. MATLAB is used for training the classifiers
     
## Project 3: A comparative study on the approaches to Transforming Natural Language into Visualizations
